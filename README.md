#### How to add new class?
#### If you want to add new classes:
1. You must have 1 class for zombie, and 1 for headcrab and they must be in the same order.
2. You can add them in 'scripts/maps/hlze/classes/' folder
- 'headcrab_classes.as' is for headcrabs.
- 'zombie_classes.as' is for zombies.
  - If you add a class for headcrab, headcrab will try to mutate to zombie class with same id as headcrab class.This means you must add your zombie class in the same order as your headcrab class.
##### Note for Mappers:
- Headcrab Players can unlock 'func_wall_toggle' with targetnames:
  - 'togg1','toggle1' <-- Not Recommended.
  - Use 'hcwall1','hcwall2',...,'hcwall9','hcwall10',...,'hcwall15';
- Zombie Players can trigger 'func_breakable' with targetname: 'flr_brk';
- Zombie Players can use all rotating doors('func_door_rotating') with targetnames: 'ds1', 'd1', 'd2', 'd3',...,'d9';
- To make Zombie Players open rotating doors('func_door_rotating'), use 'trigger_multiple'; (See Examples Folder)
- More defines can be defined in 'entities/multisource.as'

For More Doors:
```
array<array<string>>DoorEntities = { ... };
```
For More Walls:
```
array<array<string>>WallEntities = { ... };
```
For More Walls Settings:
```
array<array<string>>WallEntities_Settings = {
		....,
		{(Headcrab/Zombie)<1/0>, <Triggered when Player is Nearby>,<Triggered when Player is  Away>(Not Needed for 'func_breakable') },
  ....
};
```
- (Only defined in Crasher Class) To make Zombie Players break walls('func_breakable'), set targetnames: 'zWall', 'zWall1', 'zWall2',...,'zWall9'; (See Examples Folder)
- More defines can be defined in 'weapons/weapon_zombie.as' --->
For More Walls: 
```
  array<string>BreakableZWalls = { ... };
```
- Every door is locked with 'multisource' entity; (To block Headcrabs from opening them).
-Examples are in 'Examples' folder.
- If PvPvM Feature is Enabled, use 'info_target' with targetname: 'info_human_spawn' to create multiple spawn
points for Humans.
