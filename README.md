## ðŸ§¬ Mutation Guide ðŸ§¬:
I made Zombie/Headcrab Class and Ability System. You can use the gene points to unlock them with chat commands:
### For Zombie Players:
##### say /zc,/zclass or /zombie_class - visit Zombie Class Menu.
##### say /za, /upgrades,/ability or /abilities - visit Zombie Ability Menu.
### For Headcrab Players:
##### say /hc or /hclass - visit Headcrab Class Menu.
##### say /ha,/hca,/hc_ability or /hc_upgrades - visit Headcrab Ability Menu.
> Example: bind tab "say /zc";

#### Gameplay:
>-As a Headcrab,find a victim and infect it. <br>
Once infected, it will take some time to turn the victim into a zombie. <br>
-As a zombie, you need to find food(human bodies) and press your 'USE' key to eat. <br>
When eating,you gain GENE POINTS and regenerate host's body and your headcrab's health. <br>
Spent gene points in Zombie Class Menu to unlock new classes and abilities. <br>
If you reach 0 Armor(Host's body health) you will leave that body and play as a headcrab. <br>
To manually leave body, press 'RELOAD' key. <br>

<summary>Configuration:</summary>
- Configuration Files are stored inside 'scripts/maps'. <br>
- Global Configuration File is: 'hlze_global.ini' <br>
- Per Map Configuration File is loaded as: '[map_name].hlze.ini' <br>
<h4>The mod is not starting ?!?!?!</h4>
Its probably because of Save/Load System.<br>

```
Make sure to create some aditional folders to match this path 'svencoop/scripts/maps/store/hlze'
```
<h4>The mod still won't start ?!?!!</h4>
I don't know, email me. <br>
<h4>How to add new class?</h4>
<h5>If you want to add new classes:</h5>
1. You must have 1 class for zombie, and 1 for headcrab and they must be in the same order. <br>
2. You can add them in 'scripts/maps/hlze/classes/' folder <br>
- 'headcrab_classes.as' is for headcrabs. <br>
- 'zombie_classes.as' is for zombies. <br>
  - If you add a class for headcrab, headcrab will try to mutate to zombie class with same id as headcrab class.This means you must add your zombie class in the same order as your headcrab class. <br>

<summary>Note for Mappers:</summary>
- Headcrab Players can unlock 'func_wall_toggle' with targetnames: <br>
